abstract = {This well-respected text gives an introduction to the modern approximation techniques and explains how, why, and when the techniques can be expected to work. The authors focus on building students' intuition to help them understand why the techniques presented work in general, and why, in some situations, they fail. With a wealth of examples and exercises, the text demonstrates the relevance of numerical analysis to a variety of disciplines and provides ample practice for students. The applications chosen demonstrate concisely how numerical methods can be, and often must be, applied in real-life situations. In this edition, the presentation has been fine-tuned to make the book even more useful to the instructor and more interesting to the reader. Overall, students gain a theoretical understanding of, and a firm basis for future study of, numerical analysis and scientific computing. A more applied text with a different menu of topics is the authors' highly regarded NUMERICAL METHODS, Third Edition.},

abstract = {In this third article of the series, a new anisotropic united atoms (AUA) intermolecular potential parameter set has been proposed for the carbon force centers connecting the aromatic rings of polyaromatic hydrocarbons to predict thermodynamic properties using both the Gibbs ensemble and NPT Monte Carlo simulations. The model uses the same parameters as previous AUA models used for the aromatic CH force centers. The optimization procedure is based on the minimization of a dimensionless error criterion incorporating various thermodynamic data of naphthalene at 400 and 550 K. The new model has been evaluated on a series of polyaromatic and naphthenoaromatic hydrocarbons over a wide range of temperatures up to near-critical conditions. Vaporization enthalpy, liquid density, and normal boiling temperature are reproduced with good accuracy. The new potential parameters have also been tested successfully on toluene, 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, styrene, m-xylene, n-hexylbenzene, and n-dodecylbenzene to demonstrate their transferability to alkylbenzenes.},

abstract = {The parameters of the anisotropic united atom (AUA) intermolecular potential for n-alkanes originally proposed by Toxvaerd [J. Chem. Phys. 93, 4290 (1990)] [AUA(3)] was optimized by Ungerer et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 112, 5499 (2000)] [AUA(4)] on the basis of equilibrium properties (vapor pressures, vaporization enthalpies, and liquid densities). In this work we analyze the influence of the torsion potential in the internal and collective dynamics of the AUA model. The modified potential [AUA(4m)] preserves all the intermolecular parameters and only explores an increment in the trans-gauche and gauche(+)-gauche(-) transition barrier of the torsion potential. This modification better reproduce different transport properties (shear viscosity, self-diffusion coefficient, and internal relaxation times), keeping the accuracy achieved in our previous work for equilibrium properties. An extensive investigation of the shear viscosity of ethane, n-pentane, n-dodecane, and n-eicosane in a wide range of pressures and temperatures shows that the AUA(4m) improves the accuracy of the original AUA(4), reducing the absolute average deviation from 30{\%} to 14.5{\%}. Finally, the self-diffusion coefficient of n-hexane computed with the new model in the range of 223-333 K and from 0.1 to 295 MPa is in better agreement with respect to the experimental data than the original model.},

abstract = {A potential model intended to be a general purpose model for the condensed phases of water is presented. TIP4P/2005 is a rigid four site model which consists of three fixed point charges and one Lennard-Jones center. The parametrization has been based on a fit of the temperature of maximum density (indirectly estimated from the melting point of hexagonal ice), the stability of several ice polymorphs and other commonly used target quantities. The calculated properties include a variety of thermodynamic properties of the liquid and solid phases, the phase diagram involving condensed phases, properties at melting and vaporization, dielectric constant, pair distribution function, and self-diffusion coefficient. These properties cover a temperature range from 123 to 573 K and pressures up to 40 000 bar. The model gives an impressive performance for this variety of properties and thermodynamic conditions. For example, it gives excellent predictions for the densities at 1 bar with a maximum density at 278 K and an averaged difference with experiment of 7×10−4 g/cm3.},

abstract = {A new set of united-atom Lennard-Jones interaction parameters for n-alkanes is proposed from fitting to critical temperatures and saturated liquid densities. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to determine the vapor-liquid coexistence curves for methane to dodecane using three united-atom force fields: OPLS [Jorgensen, et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984, 106, 813], SKS [Siepmann, et al. Nature 1993, 365, 330], and TraPPE. Standard specific densities and the high-pressure equation-of- state for the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE) model were studied by simulations in the isobaric-isothermal and canonical ensembles, respectively. It is found that one set of methyl and methylene parameters is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid phases of all n-alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas other n-alkane force fields employ methyl groups that are either equal or larger in size than the methylene groups, it is demonstrated here that using a smaller methyl group yields a better fit to the set of experimental data. As should be expected from an effective pair potential, the new parameters do not reproduce experimental second virial coefficients. Saturated vapor pressures and densities show small, but systematic deviation from the experimental data.},

@article{Kofke1993b,
abstract = {Thermodynamic integration along a path that coincides with the saturation line is propose as an efficient means for evaluation of phase equilibria by molecular simulation. The technique allows coexistence to be determined by just one simulation, without ever attempting or performing particle insertions. Prior knowledge of one coexistence point is required to start the procedure. Integration then advances from this state according to the Clapeyron formula-a first-order ordinary differential equation that prescribes how the pressure must change with temperature to maintain coexistence. The method is unusual in the context of thermodynamic integration in that the path is not known at the outset of the process; results from each simulation determine the course that the integration subsequently takes. Predictor-corrector methods among standard numerical techniques are shown to be particularly well suited for this type of integration. A typical integration step along the saturation line proceeds as follows: An increment in the temperature is chosen, and the saturation pressure at the new temperature is ''predicted'' from previous data (the initial coexistence datum and/or previous simulations). Simultaneous but independent NPT simulations of the coexisting phases are initiated at the said conditions. Averages taken throughout the simulations are repeatedly used to ''correct'' the estimate of the pressure to convergence. Thus strictly the pressure is not fixed during the simulation. Vapor-liquid coexistence of the van der Waals model is first used to study the numerical integration method without the complications of molecular simulation. In a second application the phase envelope of the Lennard-Jones model fluid is computed, and many variations of the technique are examined. Overall, the results are remarkably consistent and in agreement with previous simulation studies. Difficulty is encountered upon approach of the critical point, but, by artificially coupling the simulation volumes, the method remains effective in this regime so long as a suitably small integration step is employed. Many extensions and improvements of the technique are discussed.},

abstract = {We use the Mayer sampling method, with both direct and overlap sampling, to calculate and compare classical virial coefficients up to B6 for various water models (SPC, SPC/E, MSPC/E, TIP3P, and TIP4P). The precision of the computed values ranges from 0.1{\%} for B2 to an average of 25{\%} for B6. When expressed in a form scaled by the critical properties, the values of the coefficients for SPC water are observed to greatly exceed the magnitude of corresponding coefficients for the simple Lennard-Jones model. We examine the coefficients in the context of the equation of state and the Joule-Thomson coefficient. Comparisons of these properties are made both to established molecular simulation data for each respective model and to real water. For all models, the virial series up to B5 describes the equation of state along the saturated vapor line better than the series that includes B6. At supercritical temperatures, however, the sixth-order series often describes pressure-volume-temperature behavior better than the fifth-order series. For example, the sixth-order virial equation of state for SPC/E water predicts the 673 K isotherm within 8{\%} of published molecular simulation values up to a density of 9 mol/L (roughly half the critical density of SPC/E water).},

The values are used to calculate the equation of state for butane and the pressure-density behavior is compared to experimental data at 350 and 550 K. Critical points are calculated for all systems and compared to simulation data previously taken for the same molecular model, and to experiment. The comparison with temperature is very good (within 1.5{\%} for all chain lengths up to n=12), while the critical density is underestimated by about 5{\%}-15{\%} and the critical pressure is given within about 10{\%}. The convergence behavior of the virial equation of state as applied across the n-alkane series is well characterized by corresponding states, meaning that the accuracy at a given density relative to the critical density does not deteriorate with increasing chain length.},

abstract = {In this study, Monte Carlo simulation techniques based on the anisotropic united atom (AUA) potential have been used to predict thermodynamic properties, comprising saturation pressures, vaporization enthalpies and liquid densities, at different temperatures for several isoalkanes (2,3-dimethylpentane, 2,4-dimethylpentane), alkylbenzenes (propylbenzene and hexylbenzene), alkyl-substituted cycloalkanes (propylcyclohexane and propylcyclopentane), polycyclic alkanes (trans-decalin), and naphtenoaromatics (tetralin and indan), representing gasoil range fractions of hydrocarbons. This variety of hydrocarbons with different molecular structures served to demonstrate the transferability of the AUA potential parameters. For this purpose, two types of Monte Carlo algorithm were used: the Gibbs ensemble algorithm to predict equilibrium properties at high temperatures, and the NPT algorithm followed by the thermodynamic integration to extend the prediction to lower temperatures. Techniques increasing the efficiency of the algorithms such as configuration bias, reservoir bias, and parallel tempering were also implemented in the algorithms. Based on available experimental information, good predictions of equilibrium properties were obtained for all the hydrocarbon families studied, and small differences between isomers were represented with a good accuracy. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The second virial coefficient A2 of chain molecules modelled as Lennard-Jones beads connected by rigid rods is calculated using Monte Carlo simulations for a variety of chain lengths and temperatures. The second virial coefficient is found to vary with chain length in different ways depending on the temperature regime. From the second virial coefficient expressions the 'effective' interaction (potential of mean-force) between a pair of polymer chains is obtained. This potential is found to be strongly dependent on chain length and temperature, reflecting directly the different conformational behaviour of the chains in different temperature regimes. It is found that for all chains with more than three segments the effective interaction at zero separation of the centre of mass is finite. We find that at the Boyle temperature, defined by A2(T(B)) = 0, the chains of finite length have excluded volume statistics. The molecules of finite chain length are found to behave as ideal chains for a temperature significantly below T(B). Thus, the temperature at which the solvent changes from 'good' to 'poor' depends on whether the polymer chains are at infinite dilution or at finite density. An analogous analysis of our simulation data which is also performed with experimental data shows that our simulations are able to explain the observed behaviour of the Flory-Huggins chi parameter. However, it is noted that a similar interpretation of the experimental observations should be limited to a very narrow range of temperatures.},

The thermochemical data available include enthalpies of formation, enthalpies of phase transitions, and heat capacities. Thermochemical properties of many reactions that support enthalpy of formation values are provided. Automated tools are used to check data prior to its inclusion in the web site. Most of the collections in the site provide extensive coverage of the literature in their field and include relevant metadata such as the experiment type or important auxiliary data. These features make the site an excellent tool for data evaluation. A major goal of the project was to provide convenient access to all types of chemical data. Several challenges were encountered in the development of systems and conventions for concisely and accurately displaying chemical data on the Internet. The next phase of the evolution of the site will be the addition of tools to aid researchers in getting data from the site. Data from the site have found applications in industrial, research, and educational settings. Usage patterns for the site will be discussed.},

abstract = {In this review we focus on the determination of phase diagrams by computer simulation with particular attention to the fluid-solid and solid-solid equilibria. The calculation of the free energy of solid phases using the Einstein crystal and Einstein molecule methods are described in detail. It is shown that for the hard spheres solid both methods yield the same results and that free energies of solid phases present noticeable finite size effects. Finite size corrections can be introduced, although in an approximate way, to correct for the dependence of the free energy on the size of the system. The computation of free energies of solid phases can be extended to molecular fluids. The procedure to compute free energies of solid phases of water (ices Ih, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, XI and XII) using the SPC/E and TIP4P models will be described.Other methods to estimate the melting point of a solid, as the direct fluid-solid coexistence or simulations of the free surface of the solid will be discussed. It will be shown that the melting points of ice Ih for several water models, obtained from these two methods and from free energy calculations agree within statistical uncertainty. Phase diagram calculations can help to improve potential models of molecular fluids; for water, the TIP4P/2005 model can be regarded as an improved version of TIP4P. We will also review some recent work on the phase diagram of the simplest ionic model, the restricted primitive model. Although originally devised to describe ionic liquids, the model is becoming quite popular to describe charged colloids. Besides the possibility of obtaining fluid-solid equilibria for simple protein models will be discussed. In these primitive models, the protein is described by a spherical potential with certain anisotropic bonding sites.},

abstract = {The vapor-liq. equil. of three recently proposed water models have been computed using Gibbs-Duhem simulations. These models are TIP4P/Ew, TIP4P/2005, and TIP4P/ice and can be considered as modified versions of the TIP4P model. By design TIP4P reproduces the vaporization enthalpy of water at room temp., whereas TIP4P/Ew and TIP4P/2005 match the temp. of max. d. and TIP4P/ice the melting temp. of water. Recently, the m.p. for each of these models has been computed, making it possible for the first time to compute the complete vapor-liq. equil. curve from the triple point to the crit. point. From the coexistence results at high temp., it is possible to est. the crit. properties of these models. None of them is capable of reproducing accurately the crit. pressure or the vapor pressures and densities. Addnl., in the cases of TIP4P and TIP4P/ice the crit. temps. are too low and too high, resp., compared to the exptl. value. However, models accounting for the d. max. of water, such as TIP4P/Ew and TIP4P/2005 provide a better est. of the crit. temp. In particular, TIP4P/2005 provides a crit. temp. just 7 K below the exptl. result as well as an extraordinarily good description of the liq. densities from the triple point to the crit. point. All TIP4P-like models present a ratio of the triple point temp. to the crit. point temp. of about 0.39, compared with the exptl. value of 0.42. As is the case for any effective potential neglecting many body forces, TIP4P/2005 fails in describing simultaneously the vapor and the liq. phases of water. However, it can be considered as one of the best effective potentials of water for describing condensed phases, both liq. and solid. In fact, it provides a completely coherent view of the phase diagram of water including fluid-solid, solid-solid, and vapor-liq. equil. [on SciFinder (R)]},

With this extrapolation method, a Mayer-sampling Monte Carlo simulation of the SPC/E (extended simple point charge) water model quantitatively predicted the second virial coefficient as a continuous function spanning over four orders of magnitude in value and over three orders of magnitude in temperature with less than a 2{\%} deviation. In addition, the same simulation predicted the second virial coefficient if the site charges were scaled by a constant factor, from an increase of 40{\%} down to zero charge. This method is also shown to perform well for the third virial coefficient and the exponential parameter for a Lennard-Jones fluid.},

abstract = {The parameters of the anisotropic united atom (AUA) intermolecular potential for n-alkanes originally proposed by Toxvaerd [J. Chem. Phys. 93, 4290 (1990)] [AUA(3)] was optimized by Ungerer et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 112, 5499 (2000)] [AUA(4)] on the basis of equilibrium properties (vapor pressures, vaporization enthalpies, and liquid densities). In this work we analyze the influence of the torsion potential in the internal and collective dynamics of the AUA model. The modified potential [AUA(4m)] preserves all the intermolecular parameters and only explores an increment in the trans-gauche and gauche(+)-gauche(-) transition barrier of the torsion potential. This modification better reproduce different transport properties (shear viscosity, self-diffusion coefficient, and internal relaxation times), keeping the accuracy achieved in our previous work for equilibrium properties. An extensive investigation of the shear viscosity of ethane, n-pentane, n-dodecane, and n-eicosane in a wide range of pressures and temperatures shows that the AUA(4m) improves the accuracy of the original AUA(4), reducing the absolute average deviation from 30{\%} to 14.5{\%}. Finally, the self-diffusion coefficient of n-hexane computed with the new model in the range of 223-333 K and from 0.1 to 295 MPa is in better agreement with respect to the experimental data than the original model.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New YorkAn equation of state is developed for the Lennard-Jones model fluid, truncated and shifted at (Formula presented.). The underlying dataset contains thermodynamic properties at 706 state points including pressure, residual internal energy, first volume derivative of the residual internal energy, and residual isochoric heat capacity as a function of temperature and density. The equation of state is explicit in terms of the Helmholtz energy, allowing the determination of any thermodynamic property by differentiation. It is valid for temperatures (Formula presented.) and pressures (Formula presented.). High accuracy and good extrapolation behavior of the equation of state are established.},
